      Hello, Myself Pratik Shinde, I'm a Web Developer, I like to build interesting projects out of
      curiosity.
      I live in Bhigwan located near Baramati but call many pllaces my home. Most of my time I spend in
      watching web series, doing some experienments and implementing about new technologies into real
      projects just for fun.
      also, I like to travel visit historical venues, listen music, spend time with friends at evening everyday.
      My favorite web series so far is Breaking Bad.
